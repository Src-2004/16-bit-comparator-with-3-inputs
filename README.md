# 16-bit-comparator-with-3-inputs
This repository presents the complete design, simulation, and analysis of a 16-bit digital comparator capable of comparing three binary inputs: A, B, and C. The goal is to determine the maximum (or optionally minimum) value among the three inputs using digital logic circuits, typically described in Verilog or VHDL.

Project Objective:
To develop a high-speed, low-latency digital comparator that compares 16-bit binary numbers and outputs:
 1.The largest value among A, B, and C
 2.The flag or identifier of the maximum input (e.g., Max = A, Max = B, or Max = C)
 3.Optional: equality flags in case two or more values are equal
